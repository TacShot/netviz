Installation and Setup Guide

  Step 1: Install System Dependencies

  First, you need to install the necessary system-level packages for building and
  running the application. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   1 yay -S --noconfirm python-pip python-bcc base-devel libbpf elfutils 
     linux-headers llvm

  Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

  Next, set up a Python virtual environment for the backend server and install
  the required Python packages.

    1 # Navigate to the server directory
    2 cd server
    3 
    4 # Create a Python virtual environment
    5 python3 -m venv venv
    6 
    7 # Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies
    8 bash -c "source venv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip && pip 
      install -r requirements.txt"
    9 
   10 # Go back to the root directory
   11 cd ..

  Step 3: Install Node.js Dependencies

  Now, install the dependencies for the graphical user interface (GUI).

   1 # Navigate to the gui directory
   2 cd gui
   3 
   4 # Install Node.js dependencies
   5 npm install
   6 
   7 # Go back to the root directory
   8 cd ..

  Step 4: Build the Application

  With all dependencies installed, you can now build the application using the
  provided build script.

   1 bash scripts/build.sh

  Step 5: Run the Application

  The build process creates a distribution package in the dist/ directory. To run
  the application, navigate to the dist/netviz/ directory and execute the run.sh
  script.

   1 cd dist/netviz/
   2 ./run.sh

  Important Note:
  The eBPF program (ebpf/network_monitor.c) could not be compiled due to complex
  kernel header compatibility issues. As a result, the eBPF monitoring
  functionality will not be active when you run the application. The Python
  backend and the GUI will still run, but you will not see real-time network
  data. To get the eBPF part working, the eBPF C code needs to be significantly
  modified to be compatible with your system's kernel and eBPF development
  environment.
